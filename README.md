# Music Moods
by Balchetan Grewal
### A simple music data grapher

---

This application allows the user to utilize the SpotifyAPI to search for artists and grab their albums. The user can then select an album by clicking on it to get a chart of music feature data for all songs on that album. The charts are created by the Google API using data obtained from the SpotifyAPI. To use the SpotifyAPI, a unique access token is needed from Spotify. This token expires after one hour, so this app also uses moment.js to track the expiration time, so that a new token can be obtained when one expires.
